i-INSPIRE To Do:

1) Pseudo-code
   a) module for nanospec camera
      *initialise nanospec (whatever this entails)
      *take frame
      *read out frame (buffer?)
      *write frame (where? straight to SD memory?)
   b) module for pinhole camera (simpler control system)
      *initialise pinhole camera
      *take frame
      *write frame (where? also to SD memory?)
   c) module to read data from SD card
   d) module for radiation counter
   e) module to write data to BX24
   f) diagnostics module for BX24 and instruments
      *maybe this needs to have various states of "OK"
   [g) comms with transceiver
      *turn transceiver on
      *turn transceiver off
      *get transceiver to transmit] - Xiaofeng to find module that does all this.

2) Test the pinhole camera.
   a) wire for BX24
   b) write control module for camera
   c) test data transfer/storage w/ memory expansion kit

3) Assemble and test CMOS for i-INSPIRE
   a) purchase items (pinhole camera included here)
   b) company to assemble the board.
   c) board testing in lab
      *wire up power for chip etc. 
      *wire up serial connection to BX24
      *write control module
      *test control module - NB data transfer/storage on BX24/expansion kit

4) Radiation Counter
   a) development of fibre radiation counter
   b) lab testing
   c) calibration
   d) control module.
